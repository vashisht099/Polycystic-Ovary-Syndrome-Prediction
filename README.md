# Polycystic-Ovary-Syndrome-Prediction

#Overview
This PCOS prediction project is designed to predict the possibility of having Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on input variables such as age, BMI, menstrual cycle irregularity, and other relevant factors. The model is built using machine learning techniques and trained on a dataset of individuals diagnosed with PCOS.

#Data Collection
The data collection process involved creating a Google Form survey that included questions related to PCOS symptoms, lifestyle habits, and demographic information. The survey was distributed to individuals who had or had been not diagnosed with PCOS and were willing to participate in the study.

The survey responses were collected and stored in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed to remove any duplicate or irrelevant responses, as well as to handle missing values.

#Data Preparation
After cleaning the data, it was split into training and testing datasets. The training dataset was used to train the machine learning model, while the testing dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the model.

#Model Building
The PCOS prediction model was built using Python and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The model was trained using a variety of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

The model was optimized using hyperparameter tuning techniques to achieve the best possible performance. The final model was then evaluated on the testing dataset to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
